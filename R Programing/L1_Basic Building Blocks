Lesson 1:
1. data structure - Any object that contains data
2. numeric vectors - are the simplest type of data structure in R.
3. c() - 'concatenate' or 'combine'; creates a vector
4. Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions.
5. abs() - get the absolute value
6. sqrt() - get the square root value
7. R simply performs the specified arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element.
8.  vector 'recycling' - If the vectors are of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length as the longer vector. 
z <- (2, 9, 3.14)
z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

Take Note:
If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

9. auto-completion - You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once).
